# word-guess

### A few comments:
1. Had quite a bit of fun on this assignment, and completed the bonus criteria plus a few other "I just want to try out aspects". That includes:
..* Leveraged a few functions found on stack overflow (references in comments) - primarily string utilities
..* Image loaded when the correct name is guessed
..* Leveraged the GOT API to pull back character data when the correct name is guessed (because, why not)
2. Bootstrap 4 was leveraged with very basic additional styling
3. Responsive design, but couldn't use touch for mobile (/sad)
